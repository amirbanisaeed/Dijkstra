# Dijkstra
Implementation of Dijkstra Algorithm


In this problem, we try to find the the total cost of a flight. For this, we are given a weighted graph: the weight of an edge from one city to another one is the cost of the corresponding flight.


we are given an directed graph with positive edge weights and with 𝑛 vertices and 𝑚 edges as well as two vertices 𝑢 and 𝑣, compute the weight of a shortest path between 𝑢 and 𝑣 (that is, the minimum total weight of a path from 𝑢 to 𝑣).
